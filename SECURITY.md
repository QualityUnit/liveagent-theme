# Security Policy

Although we strive to create the most secure products possible, we are not perfect. If you happen to find a security vulnerability in one of our services, we would appreciate letting us know and allowing us to respond before disclosing the issue publicly. We take security seriously, and we will try to review and reply to every legitimate security report personally within 24 hours. Other reports submitted will not be replied to.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest released version and `main` branch is supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
